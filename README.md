# Sentiment Analysis of Indiana's Firearm Legislation Using NLP 📊🔍

This project aims to harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to shed light on the sentiments surrounding Indiana's legislation on gun ownership without a license. Using Twitter data, the analysis provides invaluable insights into public sentiments pre and post the implementation of this legislation.


## Overview 🌐

The sentiment analysis employs the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) methodology, a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that's especially attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.

## Key Features 🌟

- *Two-phase Examination:* A comprehensive sentiment analysis both before and after the law's enactment.
- *Gun Crime Analysis:* Examination of tweets related to gun crime in Indiana post the legislation's implementation.

## Insights 📈

### Pre and Post-Implementation Analysis

The pre-implementation data showed a significant negative sentiment among individuals expressing concerns about the legislation. However, the post-implementation data revealed a marked decrease in negative sentiment, with a minimal number of tweets expressing concerns about the law's impact.

### Gun Crime Sentiment Analysis

Our analysis goes beyond just the legislation, delving into gun crime in Indiana. A noticeable decline in tweets related to gun crime was observed post the legislation, suggesting a potential positive impact.

## Conclusion 📜

The project revealed the power and importance of sentiment analysis in understanding public opinion. The notable decrease in negative sentiment post-implementation, combined with the decline in gun crime-related tweets, indicates a potential positive public and societal response to the legislation. Such insights are invaluable to policymakers and stakeholders alike.
